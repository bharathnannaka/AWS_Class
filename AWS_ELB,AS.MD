### Auto Scaling:
Auto scaling is a feature that allows a system to automatically adjust its resources based on the current demand.

### types of Auto Scaling:

### Manual scaling:
In this type of scaling, the number of instances is changed manually.

### Scheduled scaling:
This type involves the automatic execution of scaling actions based on certain schedules.

### Dynamic scaling:
In dynamic scaling, the number of EC2 instances is changed automatically based on signals that are provided by a CloudWatch alarm. Dynamic scaling is mostly employed when there is unpredictable traffic.

### Predictive scaling:
Predictive scaling involves using machine learning algorithms to program the desired number of instances. Future traffic can be predicted to provide the appropriate number of instances. This type of scaling is ideal when the traffic is predictable.
